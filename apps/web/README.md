# Movie Watchlist — Web

The Next.js web client. Browse trending, now-playing and upcoming movies plus currently airing TV — filtered by region — search the TMDB catalog, keep a personal watchlist, and mark episodes watched.

Part of the [Movie Watchlist monorepo](../../README.md); it shares a Supabase project and the TMDB client (`@moviewatchlist/shared`) with the [Expo app](../mobile/README.md), so accounts and data are the same on both.

## Features

- **Home page** — Trending hero banner, now-playing and upcoming movies, and currently airing TV, filtered by region
- **Region selection** — ISO 3166-1 country codes (US, CA, GB, etc.) for region-specific release dates
- **Search** — Full-text search across the TMDB catalog
- **Detail pages** — Poster, genres, rating, runtime, overview, directors, cast, and trailers, for movies and TV shows
- **Episode tracking** — Season pages with per-episode watched state
- **Accounts** — Sign-up, login, and a profile page, backed by Supabase auth
- **Watchlist** — Save titles and move them between watch statuses
- **Trailer playback** — Embedded YouTube trailers via a modal dialog
- **Dark/Light theme** — System-aware with manual toggle
- **Responsive design** — Mobile-first layout

## Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) (App Router, Server Components)
- [React 19](https://react.dev)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com) — authentication and Postgres
- [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com) — headless component primitives

- [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev) — icons
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) — end-to-end and accessibility testing

Movie and TV data is sourced from [The Movie Database (TMDB) API v3](https://developer.themoviedb.org).

## Getting Started

### Environment

Copy [`.env.example`](.env.example) to `.env` in this directory and fill it in:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `TMDB_API_KEY` | TMDB read access token. **Server-only** |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | TMDB API base URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_IMAGE_PATH` | TMDB image CDN base |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | Absolute site URL, used for `metadataBase` and canonicals. No trailing slash |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME` | Site name, used in page titles |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase anon key |

A free TMDB read access token comes from [themoviedb.org/settings/api](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api). Use the long **API Read Access Token**, not the short v3 API key — it is sent as a bearer token. Store it on its own: the `Bearer ` prefix is added in code.

`TMDB_API_KEY` is deliberately not prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. It is read only on the server, and browser requests reach TMDB through the route handlers in `src/app/api`. Anything prefixed `NEXT_PUBLIC_` is inlined into the client bundle, so no secret belongs there.

> Use `.env` rather than `.env.local`. Next.js reads either, but `playwright.config.ts` loads `.env` specifically — put values only in `.env.local` and the metadata tests will compare against `undefined`.

Supabase credentials are required even for browsing: `src/proxy.ts` refreshes the session on every page request and will fail without them.

### Run the development server

From the repo root:

```bash
pnpm --filter @moviewatchlist/web dev
```

Or from this directory, `pnpm dev`. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Other commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @moviewatchlist/web build
pnpm --filter @moviewatchlist/web lint
pnpm --filter @moviewatchlist/web exec playwright test    # E2E + accessibility
```
