 * `middleware.ts`, deliberately, not Next 16's `proxy.ts`.
 *
 * Two constraints meet here. Next 16 renamed this file to `proxy.ts` and pinned
 * it to the Node runtime with no way to configure it, while the OpenNext
 * Cloudflare adapter supports only edge middleware and fails the build on the
 * Node kind. Next 16 still honours `middleware.ts` for exactly this case, so
 * the deprecated filename is the one that works on Workers.
 *
 * Deleting it outright is not an option: `@supabase/ssr` needs a middleware to
 * refresh the access token, because Server Components cannot write cookies. Do
 * that and a signed-in visitor whose token has expired is bounced to /login by
 * the very pages that should have refreshed them.
 *
 * Revisit when Next ships edge-runtime support for `proxy`.
