## Movie Watchlist

A cross-platform app for browsing movies and TV shows, tracking a personal watchlist, and marking episodes watched. The web and mobile clients share a single Supabase project and a single TMDB client, so accounts and data are the same on both.

## Current Features

- **Trending & regional releases** — Hero banner of trending titles, now-playing and upcoming movies, and currently airing TV, filtered by country (US, CA, GB, and more)
- **Search** — Full-text search across the TMDB catalog
- **Detail pages** — Poster, genres, rating, runtime, overview, directors, cast, and trailers, for both movies and TV shows
- **Accounts** — Sign-up, login, and a user profile
- **Watchlist** — Save titles and move them between watch statuses
- **Episode tracking** — Season-by-season view with per-episode watched state
- **Mobile app** — Expo client with the same browse, search, watchlist, and episode tracking
- **Trailer playback** — Embedded YouTube trailers via an in-page modal
- **Dark/Light theme** — System-aware with a manual toggle
- **Responsive design** — Mobile-first layout

## Getting Started

Node is pinned in `.node-version` and pnpm in the root `package.json`'s `packageManager` field. Run these from the repo root — Turborepo fans each one out to the workspaces:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev      # start dev servers
pnpm build
pnpm lint
```

For per-app setup and the environment variables each one needs, see
[`apps/web/README.md`](apps/web/README.md) and [`apps/mobile/README.md`](apps/mobile/README.md).

## Upcoming Features
